# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

# Overview
This project involves the development of a prediction model to determine whether a person is diabetic or not based on specific health-related features. The model utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, employing a linear kernel for classification.

# Project Details
MODEL EVALUATION:
The trained SVM classifier's accuracy is evaluated using both the training and test datasets

PREDICTION:
Input data representing health-related features is standardized using the fitted scaler.
The trained SVM model predicts whether the input data suggests a diabetic or non-diabetic condition.
The prediction outcome is printed to indicate the predicted classification ("diabetic" or "non-diabetic").

MODEL DESCRIPTION:
The prediction model utilized in this project, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is a powerful supervised learning algorithm capable of performing classification tasks. It's widely used in machine learning for its effectiveness in handling both linear and non-linear data separations. In this particular context, the SVM algorithm with a linear kernel is employed to categorize individuals based on health indicators and predict the likelihood of diabetes.
